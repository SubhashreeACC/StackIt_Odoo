Modern learners and professionals often face challenges in finding a focused, distraction-free platform to ask questions and receive quality answers. Existing platforms are often bloated with excessive features, advertisements, or lack proper moderation tools for communities.

StackIt addresses this problem by offering a minimal yet powerful Q&A platform that prioritizes:

Simplicity in design

Ease of asking and answering

Rich formatting options

Role-based access control (Guest, User, Admin)

Tag-based categorization

Real-time notifications for user engagement

Strong moderation tools for administrators

This project was built with the goal of promoting collaborative learning and structured knowledge sharing in a clean, user-friendly environment.
